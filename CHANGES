Changes from 2.005 to 2.006  (1999-Jun-20)
---------------------------

- Started adding examples from Qt-1.44
- QComboBox::eventFilter is now virtual
- QPointArray array counts needed to be /2, so I added a
  qt_pointarrayitems type
- Virtual function return value (PIG_TOPSTACK) is not destroyed in
  PIGPOP() anymore, but is destroyed just before being reused by the next
  virtual function
- PerlQt is creating objects around 0 ptrs. I have only fixed
  pig_type_new_object_return
- pig_object_can_delete makes sure !PIG_CLASS_SUICIDAL before allowing
  perl to delete an object
- cstring type checks before attempting to newSVpv(0, 0)
- Added shortarray and shortarrayitems types to type_base


Changes from 2.004 to 2.005  (1999-Jun-17)
---------------------------

- Horror of horrors! 2.004 never worked! How will I ever live it down?
  I fixed 2.004 and am calling it 2.005.


Changes from 2.003 to 2.004  (1999-May-11)

---------------------------

- Reorganized Makefile.PL
        + Arguments to WriteMakefile are now in %Args

        + Run $Args{CC} -print-libgcc-file-name to see if -lgcc is needed
