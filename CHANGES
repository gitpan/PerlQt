Changes from 2.103 to 2.104  (2000-Feb-5)
---------------------------

- QTDIR is now set to /usr/lib/qt for LIBS search if it's not already set
- The pig_alias classes are now only for making protected methods public,
  public virtual methods are now called directly with this->QClass::method
- Typemaps were modified so they can be included in sub-modules
- Qt-2.0 templates had xfd() and some qglobal.h methods added in
- Attempted to weed out the abbreviated Qt-1.x era #include filenames


Changes from 2.102 to 2.103  (2000-Jan-26)
---------------------------

- All methods are now AUTOLOADed
- Fixed several NULL pointer errors on method arguments
- Ported the Qt-2.0 tutorials (they were different)
- Moved the headers into the include/ directory
- Changed Makefile.PL LIBS from $(QTDIR) to $ENV{QTDIR}
- Added automatic support for argc/argv arguments to QApplication
- Now compiles cleanly with -Wwrite-strings, which hopefully helps with
  gcc >= 2.95


Changes from 2.101 to 2.102  (2000-Jan-21)
---------------------------

- Copied the examples and tutorials directories to make 1.4 and 2.0
  versions of each
- Adopted C<import Qt::app> over C<use Qt::app>
- Changed the Makefile.PL to use $(QTDIR) paths by default
- Separated and enhanced the QString and QStrList code from pigtype_qt.c
- Overhauled typemap handling
- Added &delete, &continue and &break methods to every class to help
  with object destruction
- Added documentation. See doc/starting.pod


Changes from 2.100 to 2.101  (2000-Jan-19)
---------------------------

- Allow compiling with either Qt-2.0 or Qt-1.4 templates
- Added support for PerlKDE
- Rewrote symbol import functions
- Included Qt version in template dir name (Qt-1.4 and Qt-2.0)


Changes from 2.007 to 2.008  (1999-Jul-1)
---------------------------

- Added support for magical SV* arguments
- Added proper support for return-by-reference arguments
	bool *, int *, and float *


Changes from 2.006 to 2.007  (1999-Jun-22)
---------------------------

- Added minimal support for non-standard types in polymorphic prototype
  resolution. Non-standard types must be !number && !object
- Prototype resolution now always checks for sub-classes.
  isa(QPopupMenu) before isa(QWidget)
- Pig.pm now reads in all the .pig templates before writing the first one.
  That causes a small delay after the Loading Qt...
- QMenuData had several virtual methods which were implemented privately
  in its Qt sub-classes, and I simply commented those methods out
- The qdrawutil.h functions are now fully supported in QPainter
- QPixmap::loadFromData now works
- More examples


Changes from 2.005 to 2.006  (1999-Jun-20)
---------------------------

- Started adding examples from Qt-1.44
- QComboBox::eventFilter is now virtual
- QPointArray array counts needed to be /2, so I added a
  qt_pointarrayitems type
- Virtual function return value (PIG_TOPSTACK) is not destroyed in
  PIGPOP() anymore, but is destroyed just before being reused by the next
  virtual function
- PerlQt is creating objects around 0 ptrs. I have only fixed
  pig_type_new_object_return
- pig_object_can_delete makes sure !PIG_CLASS_SUICIDAL before allowing
  perl to delete an object
- cstring type checks before attempting to newSVpv(0, 0)
- Added shortarray and shortarrayitems types to type_base


Changes from 2.004 to 2.005  (1999-Jun-17)
---------------------------

- Horror of horrors! 2.004 never worked! How will I ever live it down?
  I fixed 2.004 and am calling it 2.005.


Changes from 2.003 to 2.004  (1999-May-11)
---------------------------

- Added descriptions to MANIFEST
- Changed #include "" to <> for Qt headers
- Indicate hidden arguments with the @ in {@type}
- Argument return types now parse {type(...)} block
- static int xfd() : ConnectionNumber(qt_xdisplay()) added to Qt.pig
- Started adding scoped arguments with data to be destroyed on scope exit
- Added pig_croak to replace die() and croak() in C++
- Added QString, QObjectList and QWidgetList types
- Adjusted prototypes for bit types in Qt


Changes from 2.002 to 2.003  (1999-Apr-22)
---------------------------

- Reorganized Makefile.PL
        + Arguments to WriteMakefile are now in %Args
        + If bincompat3 eq 'y', PATCHLEVEL = 3
        + Run $Args{CC} -print-libgcc-file-name to see if -lgcc is needed
- Added a pig_type_this_object type, which croaks when this is null
- Fixed export of $Qt::app to specify GvIMPORTED_SV_on
- Set pig_argument_idx = 0 in pig_begin
- pig_find_in_array is fixed, it was completely broken
- Check for null pointer in pig_object_extract and pig_object_cast
- Perl-5.003 supported, #undef debug and #undef dirty to clean namespace


Changes from 2.001 to 2.002  (1999-Apr-6)
---------------------------

- Replaced all references to PIG_PROTO_LONG_DOUBLE with PIG_PROTO_LDOUBLE
  and added the long double type.
