Here is my list of things to do in a random descending list of priority.

* FIX THE MEMORY LEAK!

* require 5.004;

* fix extract_ptr()!!! Perhaps by making THIS a hash with type-names as
elements? Perhaps also allowing multiple-inheritance? Hey, just a thought.

* Fix the P* copy constructor prototypes

* Perhaps fix the inheritance trees for 'efficiency'

* Add tests to check whether THIS and DELETE are valid.

* Allow more data-types to be passed as arguments to signals/slots
and do minimal argument parsing.

* Get the typemap to read from className and convert to THAT type, not the
one requested

* Perhaps interface QArray to make access to QPointArray easier?

* Write a QGlobal::import() that will only initialize enum values if
they are requested by a module.

* Fix the include tree

* Move most of virtual.h into the other headers

* Create a pembed

* Write a C++ Qt to PerlQt converter (in Perl)

* Add tests

* Config script

* Compile everything as one library, and see if there is any benefit.

* Allow connections to closure slots.

* Arbitrary argument-lists (...) between Perl signals and Perl slots.

* Make libperlqt more generic, so as to support other scripting languages?

* Overloaded signals/slots

* Rewrite the whole thing in SWIG, to allow all the other scripting
languages in the world to bask in the glory of PerlQt.
