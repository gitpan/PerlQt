Daniel J Mitchell
	- reported a problem involving binary incompatibility with perl5.003

Richard Moore
	- pointed out that I should be using $(QTDIR) instead of /usr/lib/qt

Randy J. Ray
	- drove me to centralize configuration data to make a single
configuration modification affect all of PerlQt, hopefully leading a
path to a configuration script...

Chris Leach
	- pointed out Solaris' choking on modification of string constants
in parse_clname()
	- submitted a patch to QRect adding prototypes, and a patch for the
forever example

Franklin R. Belew
	- noticed a lack of a warning on passing an undef argument which
is converted to a NULL pointer to a function not expecting one

Bernd Johannes Wuebben
	- pointed out that a non-negligible number of people have -lqt
hidden in $(QTDIR)/lib
