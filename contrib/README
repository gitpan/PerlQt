In this directory are working PerlQt programs that aren't from the Qt
examples or tutorials. This is not exclusively for my contributions,
or for yours, but rather a congregation of generally useful programs,
and helpful examples of PerlQt programming practices.

- pqtsh
This is a PerlQt Shell. It displays a QLineEdit where you can enter
PerlQt commands on the fly. Nothing like it could ever be possible in
C++ Qt. You can enter any arbitrary Perl statement and it will be
executed immediatly. This means you can create and resize widgets on the
fly, test fonts, background colors, whatever. A great program for
experimentation and possibly even useful work.
