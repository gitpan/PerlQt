=head1 Programming PerlQt

B<Germain Garand>

This document describes a set of Perl bindings for the Qt toolkit. Contact

=head1 Introduction

PerlQt-3 is Ashley Winters' full featured object oriented interface to
L<Trolltech|"http://www.trolltech.com">'s C++ Qt toolkit v3.0.

It is based on the
L<SMOKE|"http://webcvs.kde.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/kdebindings/smoke">
library, a language independent low-level wrapper generated from Qt headers by
Richard Dale's
L<kalyptus|"http://webcvs.kde.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/kdebindings/kalyptus">
thanks to David Faure's module.

This document describes the principles of PerlQt programming.
It assumes you have some basic Perl Object Oriented programming knowledge.

Some C++ knowledge is recommended but not required.
It would mostly help you to find your way through L<Qt's
excellent online documentation|"http://doc.trolltech.com"> which is our
ultimate and only reference.


=head1 Installation

=head2 Requirements

To compile and use PerlQt, you'll need :

=over 4

=item *

a POSIX system

=item *

GNU tools : automake(>=1.5), autoconf (>=2.13), aclocal...

=item *

L<Perl E<gt>= v5.6.0|"http://www.perl.org">

=item *

L<Qt E<gt>=
v3.0|"http://www.trolltech.com/developer/download/qt-x11.html">

=item *

L<SmokeQt 1.0|"http://webcvs.kde.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/kdebindings/smoke">
The SMOKE library (Scripting Meta Object Kompiler) is part of L<KDE|"http://www.kde.org">'s B<kdebindings> module.
You may want to check if a precompiled version of this module exists for your
system.
PerlQt is packaged with its own copy, so you don't need to check it out.

=back

Perl and Qt's installation is out of the scope of this document. Please refer
to those projects' documentation.

=head2 Compilation

PerlQt uses GNU's Autoconf framework. However, the standard ./configure script is preferably driven
by the Makefile.PL wrapper. All options are forwarded to ./configure :

 perl Makefile.PL

If SMOKE is missing, C<configure> will generate its sources (4 minutes on an average system).
Then :

 make

(40 minutes average if Smoke needs to be built)

 make install

This will install PerlQt, Puic and Smoke (if needed).

The preferred install location for SMOKE and Puic is in the KDE3 file system.
If you don't have KDE3 installed, specify a location with C<configure>'s
C<--prefix> option. e.g:

 perl Makefile.PL --prefix=/usr

=head2 Troubleshooting and Configure Options

If Smoke's linking fails or your Qt library was built with very specific
options, run Makefile.PL again with:

 perl Makefile.PL --with-threshold=0

When building smoke, configure will check for OpenGL and try to compile
support for it if it is properly installed and supported by Qt.

You may disable this checking with:

 --disable-GL

Also, default behaviour is to prefer the Mesa GL library over a proprietary
implementation.
If your system features a proprietary OpenGL library, and you'd like to use
it, specify:

 --without-Mesa

=head1 Anatomy of PerlQt

A typical Qt program using GUI components is based on an event loop.

This basically means that such a program is no more envisioned as a straight
flow where you would need to handle yourself every single events (such as a
mouse click or a key press).

Instead, you just create an B<Application> object, create the GUI components it
uses,
define what objects methods need to be called when an event occurs,
and then start the main event loop.

That's all!
Qt will handle all events and dispatch them to the correct subroutine.

Lets see how this process is implemented in a minimal PerlQt program.

=head2 Hello World

 1: use Qt;
 2: my $a = Qt::Application(\@ARGV);
 3: my $hello = Qt::PushButton("Hello World!", undef);
 4: $hello->resize(160, 25);
 5: $a->setMainWidget($hello);
 6: $hello->show;
 7: exit $a->exec;

=for html
<br/>
<div class='image'><img src="../images/ex1.png"/></div>

This program first loads the Qt interface [line 1] and creates the application
object, passing it a reference to the command line arguments array C<@ARGV>
[l.2].
This application object is unique, and may later be accessed from
anywhere through the B<Qt::app()> pointer.

At line 3, we create a PushButton, which has no parent (i.e : it won't be
contained nor owned by another widget).
Therefore, we pass to the constructor an B<undef> value for the parent argument,
which is PerlQt's way of passing a Null pointer.

After some layouting at [l.4], we tell the application object that our main
widget is this PushButton [l.5]... that way, it will know that closing the
window associated with this widget means : I<quit the application>.

Now the last steps are to make this widget visible (as opposed to
hidden, which is the default) by calling the B<show> method on it [l.6] and
to start the application loop [l.7].

B<Syntax elements summary :>

=over 4

=item 1

All Qt classes are accessed through the prefix B<Qt::>, which replaces the 
initial B<Q> of Qt classes.
When browsing the L<Qt
documentation|"http://doc.trolltech.com>, you simply need to change the
name of classes so that B<QFoo> reads B<Qt::Foo>.

=item 2

An object is created by calling the B<constructor> of the class. It has the 
same name as the class itself.

You don't need to say C<new Qt::Foo> or C<Qt::Foo-E<gt>new()> as most Perl
programmers would have expected.

Instead, you just say :

 my $object = Qt::<classname>(arg_1, ..., arg_n);
 

If you don't need to pass any argument to the constructor, simply say :

 my $object = Qt::<classname>;
 

=item 3

Whenever you need to pass a Null pointer as an argument, use Perl's B<undef> 
keyword.

Pointers are arguments preceded by an B<*> 
character in Qt's documentation (e.g: "C<QWidget * widget>").

=back

=head2 Inheritance and Objects

Before we can discuss how Perl subroutines can be called back from Qt, we need
to introduce PerlQt's inheritance mechanism.

PerlQt was designed to couple as tightly as possible Qt's simplicity and Perl's 
power and flexibility.

In order to achieve that goal, the classical Object Oriented Perl paradigm had 
to be extended, much in the same way than Qt itself
had to extend C++'s paradigm with B<metaobjects>.

=head3 A Custom Widget

Lets rewrite the "Hello World!" program, this time using a custom version 
of PushButton:

  1: use strict;
  2: 
  3: package Button;
  4: use Qt;
  5: use Qt::isa qw(Qt::PushButton);
  6: 
  7: sub NEW
  8: {
  9:   shift->SUPER::NEW(@_[0..2]);
 10:   resize(130, 40);
 11: }
 12: 
 13: 1;
 14: 
 15: package main;
 16: 
 17: use Qt;
 18: use Button;
 19: 
 20: my $a = Qt::Application(\@ARGV);
 21: my $w = Button("Hello World!", undef);
 22: $a->setMainWidget($w);
 23: $w->show;
 24: exit $a->exec;

Here, we want to create our own version of the PushButton widget.
Therefore, we create a new package for it [l.3] and import Qt [l.4].

We now want to declare our widget as subclassing PushButton.
This is done through the use of the C<Qt::isa> pragma [l.5], which accepts a 
list of one or more parent Qt classes.

It is now time to create a B<constructor> for our new widget.
This is done by creating a subroutine called B<NEW> I<(note the capitalized 
form, which differentate it from the usual "new" constructor. PerlQt's NEW 
constructor is called >B<implicitly>I< as can be seen on line 21)>.

Since we want our widget to call its parent's constructor first, we call the 
B<superclass's constructor> (here: Qt::PushButton) on line 9, passing it all 
arguments we received.

At this time, a class instance has been created and stored into a special 
object holder named B<this> (not C<$this> but really just C<this>).

Each time you invoke a method from within your package, you may now 
indifferently say C<method()> or C<this-E<gt>method()>;

=head3 Using Attributes

When building a new composite widget, you may just create its different 
parts inside B<my> variables, since widgets are only deleted by their parents 
and not necessarily when their container goes out of scope.

In other words, PerlQt performs clever reference counting to prevent 
indesirable deletion of objects.

Now, you'll often want to keep an access to those parts from anywhere inside 
your package.
For this purpose, you may use the B<this> object's blessed hash, as is usual in Perl,
but that isn't really convenient and you don't have any compile time
checking...

Here come B<Attributes>. Attributes are data holders where you can 
store any kind of properties for your object.

Declaring new attributes is done through the C<use Qt::attributes> pragma, as is 
demonstrated in the following package implementation :

  1: use strict;
  2:
  3: package Button;
  4: use Qt;
  5: use Qt::isa qw(Qt::PushButton);
  6: use Qt::attributes qw(
  7:     itsTime
  8:     pData
  9: );
 10:
 11: sub NEW
 12: {
 13:   shift->SUPER::NEW(@_[0..2]);
 14:   itsTime = Qt::Time;
 15:   itsTime->start;   
 16:   pData = " Foo ";
 17: }
 18: 
 19: sub resizeEvent
 20: {
 21:    setText( "w: ". width() ." h: ". height() .
 22:             "\nt: ". itsTime->elapsed . pData );
 23: }
 24:
 25: 1;

=for html
<br/>
<div class='image'><img src="../images/ex2.png"/></div>   


An attribute itsTime is declared at line 7, and loaded with a C<Qt::Time> object 
at line 14.

Since we reimplement the virtual function "resizeEvent" [l.19].
each time the main widget is resized, this function will be triggered and 
our Button's text updated with values coming from the object [l.21] and from the 
attributes we defined [l.22].

B<Recapitulation>

=over 4

=item *

In order to inherit a Qt class, a package must contain a 
C<use Qt::isa> pragma.
e.g:
 
 use Qt::isa "Qt::widget";

=item *

The object constructor is named B<NEW> and is implicitly called.
Thus you should not say : 

 my $o = MyButton->NEW("Hello");

But say :

 my $o = MyButton("Hello"); 

=item *

Within a package, the current instance can be accessed through the B<this> 
variable.

When a member function is called, arguments are loaded as usual in the B<@_> 
array, but B<without> the object pointer itself.

Hence, you shouldn't say :

 sub myMember
 {
   my $self = shift;
   my $arg = shift;
   $arg->doThat($self); 
   $self->doIt;
 }
    
But :

 sub myMember
 {
   my $arg = shift;
   $arg->doThat(this);
   doIt;
 }

Furthermore, if you want to call a base class method from a derived class,
you'd use the specal attribute SUPER :

 sub example
 {
   print "Now calling the base class\n";
   SUPER->example(@_)
 }

Note that the :

 this->SUPER::Example(@_);

construct is also available, but will pass the object as first argument.


=item *

Whenever you need to store a contained object in your package, you may define it 
as an B<Attribute> :

 use Qt::attributes qw(
	firstAttribute
	...
	lastAttribute);

and then use it as a convenient accessor :

 firstAttribute = myContainedWidget( this );
 firstAttribute->resize( 100, 100 );

=item *

To reimplement a B<virtual function>, simply create a B<sub> with the 
same name in your object.

=back

=head2 Signals and Slots

We'll now learn how Qt objects can communicate with each other, 
allowing an event occuring, for instance, in a given widget to trigger the 
execution of one or several subroutines anywhere inside your program.

Most other toolkits use callbacks for that purpose, but Qt has a much more 
powerful and flexible mechanism called B<Signals and Slots>.

Signals and slots are used for communication between objects.

This can be thought off as something similar to the wiring between several Hi-fI 
components : an amplificator, for instance, has a set of output signals, wich are 
emitted wether a listening device is connected to them or not. Also, a tape 
recorder deck can start to record when it receives a signal wired to it's input 
slot, and it doesn't need to know that this signal is also received by a CD 
recorder device, or listened through headphones.

A Qt component behaves just like that. It has several output B<Signals> and 
several input B<Slots> - and each signal can be connected to an unlimited number 
of listening slots of the same type, wether they are inside or outside the 
component.

The general syntax of this connection process is either :

Qt::Object::connect( sender, SIGNAL 'mysignal(arg_type)', 
receiver, SLOT 'myslot(arg_type)');

or

myObject->connect( sender, SIGNAL 'mysignal(arg_type)', SLOT 
'myslot(arg_type)');

This mechanism can be extended at will by the declaration of custom Signals and 
Slots, through the C<use Qt::signals> and C<use Qt::slots> pragma.

Each declared slot will call the corresponding subroutine in your object, 
each declared signal can be raised through the B<emit> keyword.

B<As an example, lets rewrite again our Button package :>

  1: use strict;
  2:
  3: package Button;
  4: use Qt;
  5: use Qt::isa qw(Qt::PushButton);
  6: use Qt::attributes qw(itsTime);
  7: use Qt::slots 
  8:     wasClicked => [],
  9:     change     => ['int', 'int'];
 10: use Qt::signals
 11:     changeIt   => ['int', 'int'];
 12:
 13: sub NEW
 14: {
 15:   shift->SUPER::NEW(@_[0..2]);
 16:   itsTime = Qt::Time;
 17:   itsTime->start;   
 18:   this->connect(this, SIGNAL 'clicked()', SLOT 'wasClicked()');
 19:   this->connect(this, SIGNAL 'changeIt(int,int)', SLOT 'change(int,int)');
 20: }
 21: 
 22: sub wasClicked
 23: {
 24:    my $w = width();
 25:    my $h = height();
 26:    setText( "w: $w h: $h\nt: ". itsTime->elapsed );
 27:    emit changeIt($w, $h);          
 28: }
 29:
 30: sub change
 31: {
 32:    my ($w, $h) = @_;
 33:    print STDERR "w: $w h: $h \n";
 34: }
 35:
 36: 1;

In this package, we define two extra slots and one extra signal.

We know from the Qt Documentation that a clicked PushButton emits a C<clicked()> 
signal, so we connect it to our new slot at line 18.

We also connect our signal C<changeIt> to our own C<change> slot- which is 
quite stupid, but as an example.

Now, whenever our Button is clicked, the C<clicked()> signal is raised and 
triggers the C<wasClicked()> slot. C<wasClicked> then proceeds to emit 
the C<changeIt(int,int)> signal [l.27], hence triggering the C<change(int,int)> 
slot with two arguments.


=head1 RAD prototyping with Qt Designer and Puic


=head2 Introduction

As efficient and intuitive as Qt can be, building a complete GUI from scratch 
is often a tedious task.

Hopefully, Qt comes with a very sophisticated GUI Builder named Qt 
Designer, which is close to a complete integrated development environment.
It features Project management, drag'n drop GUI building, a complete object 
browser, graphical interconnection of signals and slots, and much much more.

Qt Designer's output is XML which can be parsed by several command line tools,
among whose is B<puic> (the PerlQt User Interface Compiler).

Assuming you have already built an interface file with the Designer, 
translating it to a PerlQt program is simply a matter of issuing 
one command :

 puic -x -o program.pl program.ui

This will generate the package defined in your ui file and a basic main package 
for testing purposes.

You may prefer :

 puic -o package.pm program.ui

This will only generate the package, which can then be used by a separate 
program.

=head2 Embedding Images

If you need to B<embed images or icons>, it can be done in two ways
:

=over 4

=item * Inline embedding

For this, you need to check the "Edit->Form Settings->Pixmaps->Save inline" 
checkbox inside Qt Designer.
Then : puic -x -o F<program.pl> F<program.ui>

=item * Image Collection

This option is more complex but also far more powerful and clean.

puic -o F<Collection.pm> -embed F<unique_identifier> F<image-1> ... F<image-n>

Then add a C<use Collection.pm> statement to your program's main package.

If you've created a project file in Qt Designer, and added all images 
you want to group (through "Project->Image Collection"), you'll find all those 
images inside the directory where your project file (*.pro) is stored, under 
/images.
You can then generate the corresponding image collection by issuing :

puic -o F<Collection.pm> -embed F<identifier> ../images/*

You can use as many image collections as you want in a program. Simply add a 
B<use> statement for each collection.

=back 

=head2 Working With B<.ui> Files

It will often happen that you need to regenerate your user interface -either
because you changed your initial design, or you want to extend it.
Thus writing your program's code straight in the auto-generated Perl file is
quite a bad idea.
You'd run constantly the risk of overwriting your handcrafted code, or end
up doing lot of copy-paste.

Instead, you may :

=over 4

=item * Write slots implementation in the Designer

In Qt Designer, select the I<Source> tab of the B<Object Explorer>.
There you can see a tree-like representation of your classes.
Now if you double-click on the I<Slots/public> entry,
you are prompted with a dialog where you can create a new custom slot for
your module.
Once this is done, the new slot appear inside the B<Object Explorer> tree and
clicking on it will bring you to a B<E<lt>Your ClassE<gt>.ui.h> file where you can write
the actual implementation of your slot.

Keeping all the defaults, it should look like this :

 void Form1::newSlot()
 {
 
 }

The slot declaration is actually C++ code, but simply ignore it and write
your Perl code straight between the two braces, paying special attention to
indent it at least by one space.

 void Form1::newSlot()
 {
     print STDERR "Hello world from Form1::newSlot();
     if(this->foo())
     {
         # do something
     }
 }

All Perl code written this way will be saved to the ui.h file, and B<puic> will take care of
placing it back in the final program.

Here, after running B<puic> on the Form1.ui file, you'd have:

 sub newSlot
 {
     print STDERR "Hello world from Form1::newSlot();
     if(this->foo())
     {
         # do something
     }
 }

=item * Subclassing your GUI

By using B<puic>'s I<-subimpl> option, you may generate a derived module
inheriting your original user interface.

You'd typically generate the derived module once, and write any handcrafted
code in this child.
Then, whenever you need to modify your GUI module, simply regenerate the
parent module, and your child will inherit those changes.

To generate the base module :

 puic -o Form1.pm form1.ui 

(do this as often as needed, never edit by hand)

To generate the child :

 puic -o Form2.pm -subimpl Form2 form1.ui

or

 puic -o program.pl -x -subimpl Form2 form1.ui 

(do this once and work on the resulting file)

=head1 Appendix 1 : How to use Qt Documentation

Whenever you want to use a class/method described in Qt's
L<documentation|"http://doc.trolltech.com"> from PerlQt, you
need to follow some simple translation rules.

=over 4

=item Classnames

=over 4

=item *

All classnames are changed from a B<Q> prefix in Qt to a B<Qt::> prefix
in Perl.
e.g: QComboBox is named Qt::ComboBox within PerlQt.

=back

=item Functions

=over 4

=item *

Functions referenced as B<static> are accessed directly, and not through
an object. Thus the static function Foo in class QBar would be accessed from
PerlQt as

 Qt::Bar::Foo( arg-1,...,arg-n);

The only notable exceptions concern global functions :

 qApp()     will map to Qt::app()
 qVersion() will map to Qt::version()

=item *

Functions referenced as B<members> or B<Signals> are accessed through an object
with the B<-E<gt>> operator.
e.g:

 $widget->show;

There are no fundamental differences between methods and signals, however PerlQt 
provides the B<emit> keyword as a convenient mnemonic, so that it is clear you 
are emitting a signal :

 emit $button->clicked;

=back

=item Arguments

=over 4

=item * By value

When an argument isn't preceded by the B<&> or B<*> character, it is passed by 
value. For all basic types such as int, char, float and double, PerlQt will 
automatically convert litteral and scalar values to the corresponding C++ type.

Thus for a constructor prototype written as follow in the documentation :

 QSize ( int w, int h )
 

You'd say :

 Qt::Size(8, 12);
 

=item * By reference

When an argument is preceded by the B<&> character, it means a reference to an 
object or to a type is expected. You may either provide a variable name or a 
temporary object :

 $keyseq = Qt::keySequence( &Qt::CTRL + &Qt::F3 );
 $widget->setAccel( $keyseq );
 
or

 $widget->setAccel(Qt::keySequence( &Qt::CTRL + &Qt::F3 );

If the argument isn't qualified as B<const> (constant), it means the passed
object may be altered during the process - you must then provide a variable.

=item * By pointer

When an argument is preceded by the B<*> character, it means a 
pointer to an object or to a type is expected. You may provide a variable 
name or the Perl B<undef> keyword for a Null pointer.

Similarly, if the argument isn't B<const>, the passed object may be altered by
the method call.

=back

=item Enumerations

Enumerations are sort of named aliases for numeric values that would be hard to
remember otherwise.

A C++ example would be :

 enum Strange { Apple, Orange, Lemon }

where C<Strange> is the generic enumeration name, and C<Apple>, C<Orange>,
C<Lemon> its possible values, which are only aliases for numbers (here 0, 1
and 2).

Access to enumerations values in Perl Qt is very similar to a static function
call. In fact, it B<is> a static function call.

Therefore, since you probably want to avoid some readability problems, we
recommend the use of the alternate function call syntax : C<&function>.

Lets now go back to our C<Strange> example.

If its definition was encountered in the class C<QFruits>, you'd write from
PerlQt :

 $apple_plus_orange = &Qt::Fruit::Apple + &Qt::Fruit::Orange;


=back


=head1 Appendix 2 : Internationalization

PerlQt handles internationalization by always converting B<QString> back to B<utf8> in Perl.

Conversions from Perl strings to QStrings are made according to context :

=over 4

=item * If the Perl string is already utf8-encoded

then the string will be converted straight to QString.

This is the most convenient and seemless way of internationalizing your application. Typically, one would just enable
the use of utf8 in source code with the C<use utf8> pragma and write its application with an utf8 aware editor.

=item * If the string isn't tagged as utf8, and the B<use locale> pragma is not set

then the string will be converted to QString's utf8 from B<ISO-Latin-1>.

=item * If the string isn't tagged as utf8 and the B<use locale> pragma is set

then the string will be converted to QString's utf8 according to the currently set B<locale>.

=back

Once a string contains utf8, you can convert it back to any locale by setting up B<converters> :

 $tr1=Qt::TextCodec::codecForLocale(); # this one will use current locale
 $tr2=Qt::TextCodec::codecForName("KOI8-R"); # that one forces a specific locale (Russian)

 print $tr1->fromUnicode(Qt::DateTime::currentDateTime()->toString)."\n\n";
 print $tr2->fromUnicode($my_utf8_string);

Or, with Perl >= 5.8.0, you may use Perl's B<Encode> modules (see C<perldoc Encode>).

=head1 Appendix 3 : Debugging Channels

The B<Qt::debug> module offers various debugging channels/features.

You may enable or disable it scope-wise :

 use Qt::debug;
 <...>
 {
   no Qt::debug;
   <...>
 }
 <...>
 use Qt::debug qw|calls autoload verbose|;
 <...>

With the simple C<use Qt::debug> statement, the B<verbose> and B<ambiguous> channels are activated.
If you specify a list of channels within the use statement, then only the specified channels will be enabled.

B<Available channels :>

=over 4

=item * ambiguous

Check if method and function calls are ambiguous, and tell which of the alternatives
was finally elected.

=item * verbose

Enable more verbose debugging.

Together with B<ambiguous>, tell you the nearest matches in case
a method or function call fails.
e.g:

 use Qt;
 use Qt::debug;
 $a= Qt::Application(\@ARGV);
 $a->libraryPath("foo");

 --- No method to call for :
        QApplication::libraryPath('foo')
 Closer candidates are :
        static void QApplication::addLibraryPath(const QString&)
        static QStringList QApplication::libraryPaths()
        static void QApplication::removeLibraryPath(const QString&)
        static void QApplication::setLibraryPaths(const QStringList&)

=item * calls

For every call, tell what corresponding Qt method is called
(detailing the arguments if B<verbose> is on).

=item * autoload

Track the intermediate code between a method invocation in Perl
and its resolution to either a Qt or Perl call.

=item * gc

Give informations about garbage collection
whenever a Qt object is deleted and/or a Perl object is destroyed

=item * virtual

Report whenever a virtual function tries to access its Perl
reimplementation (wether it exists or not).

=item * all

Enable all channels

=back


=head1 Appendix 4 : Marshallers

A marshaller is a piece of "glue code" translating a given datatype to another.

Within PerlQt, most Qt objects keep their object nature, so that one may invoke methods on them.
However, some classes and datatypes map so naturally to some Perl types that keeping their object nature would
would feel unnatural and clumsy.

For instance, instead of returning a Qt::StringList object, which would require an iterator to retrieve its content,
PerlQt will translate it to an array reference containing all the object's strings.

In the other way, instead of providing a Qt::StringList object as an argument of a method, one would simply
provide the reference to an array of Perl strings.

Here is the list of Marshallers as of PerlQt-3.004 :

 -----------------------------------------------------------------
