--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is not an official release of PerlQt. PerlQt is covered by the LGPL
and Perl license. Everything in the Qt, KDE_Core, and KDE_UI directories
is in the public domain. Everything in the include/ and libpqt/
directories is covered by the LGPL. The perl scripts are covered by the
Perl license. I do not, and will not, dictate any licensing terms for
the code generated by the 'pig' interface generator.

I suppose that if you use the generator to create an interface to libqt,
you become subject to the Troll Tech licensing. And if you interface
a non-Qt program, you wouldn't be. However, I'm not a lawyer and cannot
make those decisions for you. Since I'm not distributing or developing
that code, I'm not subject to anyone's license.

PerlQt and PerlKDE require the Qt library, which is copyright Troll Tech AS.
Freely distributable programs may generally use Qt for free, see README.QT
for details.
