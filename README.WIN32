PerlQt compiles under win32 with either the original perl or ActivePerl.

I recommend Perl-5.005 and Visual C++ 5 (or something) and Qt 2.0.2.

perl Makefile.PL
nmake
nmake install (if you so desire)

It's not perfect. All Windows-compatible scripts will have to end in .pl
to be double-clickable, and there's the problem of that nasty console
window. I'll see what I can arrange, okay?

Lemme know if you have problems. jql@accessone.com
