Given the huge size of the Qt module
(more than 400 classes and 13000 methods)
it doesn't have any formal documentation.

Instead, it provides two introspection tools

=over 4

=item * pqtapi: 

a command line PerlQt API introspector

=item * pqtsh:  

a graphical PerlQt shell

=back

and a detailed B<tutorial> with comprehensive
explanations. 
This is where anyone new to PerlQt
should start.

The tutorial has been originally installed 
on this system in C</usr/share/PerlQt-3>, in both B<POD> and
B<HTML> format.

For a complete IDE allowing RAD and visual programming, 
check the pqt-designer package.
