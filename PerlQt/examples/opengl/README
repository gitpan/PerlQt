Before you can run the OpenGL examples, you need to install
the OpenGL module available on CPAN (http://www.cpan.org)

Latest version is 0.54, as of 09/11/02

Both Smoke and Qt must also have been compiled with OpenGL support.

If your Qt library has OpenGL support but PerlQt complains about lacking
 methods or classes, check ./configure's config.log file for any
error that might have occured while detecting your OpenGL settings.

You might also want to check if OpenGL is properly installed on your system.
