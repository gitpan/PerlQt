To install PerlQt-2:

Look at Makefile.PL and make sure the values are reasonable.
By default, PerlQt is compiled using Qt-1.4. To change that, modify the
$MAKE variable in Makefile.PL. Please note that QTDIR does not affect
Perl's directory-search path, so you will need to set that manually if
it's not found automatically.

The QTDIR environment variable should be properly set.

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Run the programs in the tutorials/ dir to test if PerlQt works.
