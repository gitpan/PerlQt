Though this package uses GNU's Autoconf framework,
it is recommended to use the Makefile.PL wrapper
to drive the ./configure script.

perl Makefile.PL [options]
make
make test
su -c 'make install'


=====

Custom important options :

--prefix=<path to KDE3 root directory, or final install prefix>

--with-qt-dir=<path to QT3 root directory>

--without-Mesa : when detecting OpenGL support, check for a proprietary GL
                 library (e.g NVidia) and not for the MesaGL library.

--disable-GL   : do not compile OpenGL classes into the Smoke interface
                 library

--enable-smoke : force generation and compilation of the Smoke library,
                 even if it has been detected on your system

--with-threshold=<0..15> : set the lever of standardness of your Qt
                 library. Default is 10, which is reasonable.
                 If your Qt library is very customized, and you
                 experience missing symbols in libsmokeqt.so, 
                 set this to zero (paranoid level).
