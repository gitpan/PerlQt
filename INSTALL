To install PerlQt-2:

Look at Makefile.PL and make sure the values are reasonable.
By default, PerlQt is compiled using Qt-1.4. To change that, modify the
$MAKE variable in Makefile.PL

The QTDIR environment variable should be properly set.

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Run the programs in the tutorials/ dir to test if PerlQt works.
