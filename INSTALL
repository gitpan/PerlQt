This release of PerlQt requires Perl-5.004. It will not compile with
Perl-5.003, or a Perl-5.004 which is binary compatible with Perl-5.003.
It also requires Qt-1.2.

To get the latest source release of Perl, download the file
http://www.perl.org/CPAN/src/5.0/latest.tar.gz

Most of the configuration of Perl is irrelevant to PerlQt except two
points. Your perl *must* have dynamic module loading support, and
*must not* be binary-compatible with Perl-5.003. If it is, your compile
will croak with an error like "redefinition of 'debug'".


Building PerlQt is pretty easy.

First, run the Configure script. It's Perl-based, and should hopefully
work everywhere. It will ask you a few questions, the defaults are
usually correct. At the end, it will ask you of you want to build PerlQt.

Next, you will want to run the build script. It is a primitive automated
build script (written in Perl) which just runs the commands necessary to
build PerlQt without user intervention. When started, it will ask you
whether you want to install PerlQt with that build. That doesn't mean
it thinks that it has finished compiling. It asks that before the
initial compile to be as helpful as it possibly can. If you choose not
to install, it will remind you how to install PerlQt after the compile
is finished.


Now that you've finished compiling PerlQt, you can run the tutorials by
going into the tutorial's directory (t1, for example) and running:

./t1

or, if you didn't install PerlQt:

perl -Mblib t1

And that's it.

Bug-reports are welcome. Send a report, including the error, to
jql@accessone.com, and include the output from Perl -V and uname -a so I
can understand your error better.

I would gladly accept any bug-reports or suggestions regarding the Configure
and build scripts, or any other part of PerlQt.
