widgets example from Qt-1.44

widgets.cpp => widgets

This example requires the AnalogClock.pm and DigitalClock.pm widgets from
the aclock and dclock examples respectively.

This example displays several warnings on startup, has an incorrect layout
format, and dies when the checkboxes are clicked. The spinbox displays
intermittently gibberish strings. These are bugs and need to be fixed.
