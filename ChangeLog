2002-12-16 GG (v.3.004-final)
         - test suite ("make test" target) 
         - one more example (progress.pl)
         - fixed a bug related to pointer mapping and Smoke's cf_virtual flag
           (regeneration of Smoke isn't mandatory, but is recommended)
         - fixed possible redefinition of a sub in isa.pm
         - raised default test threshold to 10
         - some code optimizations (object construction/destruction)
         - added an undocumented but supported CAST function
           e.g  CAST $obj, "Qt::Application"; (it proved to be useful in some
           situations)
2002-12-11 GG. (v.3.004-RC2)
         - turnaround for segfaults with some KDE themes (KThemeStyles)
           =>will work witth kdelibs compiled with --disable-fast-malloc and --enable-fast-malloc,
           but not with --enable-fast-malloc=full
         - Qt::version() 
         - updated documentation (marshallers, debugging, i18n)
         - switch to Makefile.PL for driving ./configure

2002-12-07 GG. (v.3.004-RC1)
	- better ISO C++ compliance and portability
	  -ansi -pedantic is now almost silent except for some Perl Macros
	- speed improvements over 40%
	  ported memoïze-like cache to C++ ; various code optimizations
	- Signal/Slots inheritance now works as expected
	- proper handling of Qt modules stored in a hierarchy
	- introduced SUPER->method() construct for accessing methods in the
	  superclass
	- Internationalization
	  Perl strings are marshalled to QStrings either in utf8, iso-latin-1 or 
	  current locale according to context (the rule is: if they are tagged as utf8, use 
	  utf8 ; if not, use iso-latin by default or current locale if  the "locale" 
	  pragma is active)   ; they are always marshalled back as utf8.
	- You can now safely "eval" PerlQt code.
	- New marshallers:
	  QCString /*/&, bool */&, QValueList<int> /*/&
	- Debugging channels through "use Qt::debug"
	  You can now monitor specific parts of your application's behaviour.
	  Available channels are : ambiguous, calls, gc, autoload, virtual, 
	  verbose, all.
	- Updated documentation + french translation
	  many thanks to Stéphane Payrard for the accurate french translation !
	- Subclassing Qt::Application is now possible
	- Smoke can be built with Qt-3.1
	- Various other bug fixes
